Advent of Code 2024

## [Day 1: Historian Hysteria](day01.py)
Brute force is fine and the day seems much easier than last year's day 1

## [Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](day02.py)
Brute forced, simple loop for part 1. For part 2 I just dropped every level and short circuited when a good run was found. Both parts ran in a second, so good enough.

## Day 3: ???
