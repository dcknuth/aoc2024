# AoC2024
Advent of Code 2024

## [Day 1: Historian Hysteria](day01.py)
Brute force is fine and the day seems much easier than last year's day 1

## [Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](day02.py)
Brute forced, simple loop for part 1. For part 2 I just dropped every level and short circuited when a good run was found. Both parts ran in a second, so good enough.

## [Day 3: Mull It Over](day03.py)
Had to relearn regular expressions (for the 20th time), but after that it was OK

## [Day 4: Ceres Search](day04.py)
Started trying with NetworkX, but gave that up for a more standard walk in part 1. For part two I did another simple walk with a test function. Also considered NumPy with sub-matrixes and flattening, but seemed best to just do the walk and it finished in a second. It was a bit of code and the example didn't leave out any tricky cases, so got lucky there

## [Day 5: Print Queue](day05.py)
It has messy use of globals and is not DRY, but works. I like the sort function that I came up with

## [Day 6: Guard Gallivant](day06.py)
Again, not dry and a little long. Brute force finished in two minutes with the luck of a non-diabolical puzzle input. Would be a good one to parallelize and might add a v2 with that later

## [Day 7: Bridge Repair](day07.py)
Part two took 20 seconds to run and getting a good start overall took way longer than it should have, but done.

## Day 8: ???
